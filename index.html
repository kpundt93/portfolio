      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hey there! I'm Katie. I'm an aspiring developer with a love of solving puzzles and strategy games. I'm native to the Pacific Northwest and enjoy exploring all that it has to offer - from local eats to the seemingly endless acres of outdoor spaces. As a bit of a foodie, I also enjoy experimenting with new recipies at home and sharing them with my friends and family.</p>

      <h3>Why Epicodus?</h3>
      <p>About six months before COVID-19 changed the world, I decided that I wanted to make a career change and started exploring options in the tech world. I found my way to development and realized that with the right skills, I could make a career out of solving puzzles and helping businesses solve problems. Enter Epicodus. I chose Epicodus because I felt that they had the program I needed to refine my existing skills, learn some new ones, and get me ready to make the career switch into the tech world.</p>
